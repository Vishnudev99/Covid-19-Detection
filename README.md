# Covid-19-and-Pneumonia-detection-using-chest-x-rays
this is a web app for the detection of covid-19 and pneumonia using chest x-rays . in this app there are two seperate deep learning models , one for the detetction of cocid-19 and other for the detection of pneumonia . We have used inception v3 for the detection of covid-19 and VGG16 for the detection of pneumonia
The user will upload the chest X-ray after registering on the website/web app. Once the image is submitted, the image will go to the Flask server where the supervised training model will be used to predict the output. After this, the response will be sent back to the web app through the server.
